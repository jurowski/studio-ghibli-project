# Studio Ghibli Films - Take Home Challenge

## Overview

Create a responsive React application that displays Studio Ghibli film information using a GraphQL backend that integrates with the public Studio Ghibli API.

## Time Expectation

This project is designed to be completed in approximately 4hrs. Familiarity with AI dev tools and our tech stack may vary the actual time.

## Core Requirements

### Development Process (Required)

**You must use the dev-tasks workflow for this project:**

The AI prompts/cursor rules to accomplish 1-3 can be seen in the `.cursor/rules` directory

1. **Create a PRD**: Write a Product Requirements Document (`prd-studio-ghibli.md`) in the `/tasks` directory
2. **Generate Tasks**: Break down the PRD into actionable tasks (`tasks-prd-studio-ghibli.md`)
3. **Process Tasks**: Follow the structured task completion workflow:
   - Complete one sub-task at a time
   - Mark tasks as completed (`[x]`) when finished
   - Run tests after completing each parent task
   - Make git commits with descriptive messages using conventional commit format
   - Maintain the "Relevant Files" section as you work

**ðŸ“¹ Helpful Resource**: [Watch this video explanation of dev-tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cniTWVMGD08&t=989s) (Watch the intro sections, and when he starts talking about taskmaster, skip to 16:29 for a dev tasks explainer)

This demonstrates your ability to work with structured development processes and is a key evaluation criterion.

**It is permissible and encouraged to edit the code generated by the Dev Tasks flow**
The flow should get you most of the way there, but editing and cleaning up the code is often necessary.

### Frontend Features

1. **Four Film Buttons**: Display four buttons, each containing the name of one of the specified Studio Ghibli films. When clicked (event driven), the component should fetch that particular film from your backend resolver.
2. **Loading States**: When clicked, buttons should show a loading state
3. **GraphQL Integration**: Buttons call your GraphQL backend to fetch film data and provide properly typed hooks (useQuery, useLazyQuery, etc). Please use codegen to accomplish this.
4. **Card Display**: When the user clicks the button and the query returns the film data, the colored card should be replaced with cards showing:
   - Movie image
   - Movie title
5. **Interactive Cards**: On hover (desktop) or click (mobile), cards flip to reveal:
   - Movie banner
   - Description
   - Director
   - Release date
   - Runtime
   - Rotten Tomatoes score
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure the application works well on mobile devices
   - Cards should reorganize into a single column layout on mobile
   - Application should look good and function properly down to at least 320px width
   - Touch interactions should work smoothly for card flipping on mobile

### Backend Features

1. **GraphQL Resolvers**: Create a resolver that fetches data from the Studio Ghibli API. Think of this server as a minimal proxy server. You do not need to persist or cache data.
2. **GraphQL Schema**: Update the Schema (objectTypes) to properly type resolver data
3. **API Integration**: Connect to the public Studio Ghibli API to retrieve film information

## Film Data

The four main films to implement:

| Film Title              | API ID                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Porco Rosso             | `ebbb6b7c-945c-41ee-a792-de0e43191bd8` |
| Kiki's Delivery Service | `ea660b10-85c4-4ae3-8a5f-41cea3648e3e` |
| Howl's Moving Castle    | `cd3d059c-09f4-4ff3-8d63-bc765a5184fa` |
| My Neighbor Totoro      | `58611129-2dbc-4a81-a72f-77ddfc1b1b49` |

## Setup Instructions

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button on this GitHub repository to create your own copy
2. **Clone your fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. **Install dependencies**: Run `pnpm install` in the root directory
4. **Complete the challenge**: Follow the development process and implement the required features

## Deliverables

### 1. Public GitHub Repository

Create a public GitHub repository containing your complete project with PR against `main`.

### 2. README Documentation

Include a README with:

- **Setup Instructions**: How to install and run your project
- **Project Overview**: Brief description of your implementation
- **Dev-Tasks Process**: Documentation of your PRD and task completion workflow
- **Time Spent**: Actual time invested in the project
- **Rationale**: Technology choices and architectural decisions
- **Challenges**: Any difficulties encountered during development
- **Limitations**: Known issues or incomplete features
- **Future Improvements**: What you would add with more time

### 3. Working Application

A functional application that demonstrates the core requirements.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Development Process**: Proper use of dev-tasks workflow (PRD, task breakdown, structured completion)
- **Functionality**: Core features working as specified
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-structured code
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface and smooth interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly implementation
- **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions and project documentation
- **Time Management**: Effective use of the allocated time

## Rubric

### **1. Product Functionality & User Experience (40%)**

Design fidelity and polish are valued highly

### **2. Code Quality (30%)**

It should build, tsc compile, be devoid of dev debugging code, etc.

### **3. Development Process & Dev-Tasks Usage (20%)**

Showâ€™s proper use of Dev-Tasks and follow conventional git commits

### **4. Documentation & Communication (10%)**

Following the README should run the app properly and the mentioned field should be covered

## Notes

- Attempt to complete the task in the estimated time range. If something take longer than expected make a note of why.
- Quality over quantity - a well-implemented subset is better than a buggy complete implementation
- Don't hesitate to document any assumptions or trade-offs you make
